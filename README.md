# Home Loan Dashboard

The Home Loan Excel Dashboard provides users with a convenient way to filter certain variables and see how it affects key metrics. 
The top set of charts shows the distributions of the data. The top right chart is a histogram showing the distribution of monthly combined income for each loan request. The bottom right chart is a histogram showing the distribution of requested loan amounts. The bottom left chart is a scatterplot showing the relationship between the requested loan amount and income as well as whether the loan was approved or denied.

The bottom set of charts shows the approval odds. The left chart is a bar chart showing the approval odds based on the requested loan amount. The right chart is a bar chart showing the approval odds based on monthly income. The income and loan amount category cutoffs were calculated by dividing the data into quintiles.

The filter controls in each section of the dashboard filter data for the top and bottom set of charts respectively.
